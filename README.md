# One Search Result

> A WordPress plugin to automatically send a user to the page or post if it's the only search result available.

When there is only one search result available for a query, automatically redirect the user to that result.

## Details

This will work with any theme and any objects that would be shown in search results.

You can filter `one_search_result_pre_check` to false if you need to short-circuit and disable the redirect dynamically.
